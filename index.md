			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>StopBullyingtour.org will educate and provide information to schools, organizations and communities on what is bullying, what is cyber-bullying, who is at risk, and how you can prevent and respond to all types of bullying.</p>
			<p>With our partners we will raise money for organizations and school districts around the country and eliminate the continuing dangerous student bullying problem which is causing children to commit suicide, bad health through mental and physical harm and causing a high number of students to dropout of school.  These school districts do not have the funds to address this important problem because of budget cuts due to deficits.</p>
