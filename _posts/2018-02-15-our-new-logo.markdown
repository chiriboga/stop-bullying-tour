<h3>Why was there a change in the branding?</h3>
<p>To be totally honest, we wanted a new look. We wanted our new brand to be more kid friendly.</p>

<h3>How did the new branding come about?</h3>
<p>One of our volunteers was having a conversation with their sister and noticed that his niece was drawing the words Stop Bullying Tour in crayon. That became the inspiration for a few volunteers to take that concept and come up with the new branding you see today.</p>


<h3>What was the process?</h3>
<p>Well, this was a three person process with the final stage having the Creative Director redo it and clean it all up. Thank you to Krista Finck for her magnificant work in capturing the essense of what we were all going for and keeping the essense of the kids and the original thought.</p>
